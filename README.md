# WebScraper

An application to serve you top news from Penn Live by using a web scraper. Penn live is a news source for the Central PA area. 

How it works:
To retrieve the top new's articles the user will begin by pushing the "start scrape" button. This button triggers the application to begin scraping the website for that information. After the scraping is completed the articles will appear on the screen for the user to view. The user will be presented with the title and link for the top articles. (The user can view the contents of that article by simply clicking on the link under the title of the article. Once you click the link it will redirect you to the website to view the full article.) 

Also, the user has the ability to save articles to their saved articles page. This is allows the user to browse through all of the articles and saving their favorites to a page to revisit for a later. The save button can be found within the display of each article where you see the title and link for each of them. 

Future Plans: 
I plan on adding a feature that allows the user to comment notes on their saved articles. I find taking notes very useful when I am reading and/or researching so being able to give that feature to a user seems beneficial.
